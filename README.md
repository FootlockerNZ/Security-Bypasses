# Security Bypasses Collection

## üîê Overview

This repository showcases a series of **security bypasses personally discovered** through independent research and technical experimentation (e.g a lot of trial and error xD). Each bypass targets weaknesses in common web security mechanisms‚Äîsuch as bot protection, WAFs, caching systems, or CORS configurations‚Äîexposing subtle but impactful misconfigurations in live websites.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scope

All included examples were identified through my own analysis and testing. They highlight:

- **HTTP method-based bypasses** (e.g., unexpected behavior with `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, etc.)
- **Bypasses of caching/CDN configurations**
- **Inconsistencies in bot mitigation mechanisms**
- **Edge behavior of security layers under non-standard input**

Each case includes:

- A detailed explanation of the bypass
- A minimal proof-of-concept (PoC) script
- Observations and implications
- Ethical framing and intended purpose


## üìú Ethical Use

These findings are provided **strictly for educational and professional demonstration purposes**. All tests were conducted on publicly accessible endpoints without authentication, account access, or service disruption. If any bypass remains active in a production environment, responsible disclosure is advised.

## üß† Author

All bypasses in this repository were found and documented by **me**, through independent research. If you're interested in discussing the methodology, collaborating on security work, or learning more, feel free to reach out.
